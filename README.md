# Credit Scoring with Machine Learning and Uncertainty Estimation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project builds a **credit scoring system** that predicts loan default risk using machine learning, while incorporating **uncertainty estimation** and a **human-in-the-loop approach** for safer decision-making.  
It is based on the **German Credit Dataset (numeric version)** and demonstrates both predictive performance and decision reliability.

---

## Dataset
- **Name:** German Credit Data (numeric version)  
- **Features:** 20 numeric borrower characteristics  
- **Target:** `1` = Default, `0` = Non-default  

---

## Features
- **Multiple Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Best Model:** XGBoost with **88.4% Accuracy** and **0.92 ROC-AUC**  
- **Uncertainty Estimation:** Deep Ensembles & Monte Carlo Dropout  
- **Rejection Mechanism:** Defers high-uncertainty cases to human analysts  
- **Model Interpretability:** SHAP values to identify key predictors (repayment history, income, age)
