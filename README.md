# Credit-Scoring-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This repository contains a machine learning-based credit scoring system using the German Credit Dataset (numeric version). It predicts the likelihood of a loan default and introduces uncertainty estimation with a human-in-the-loop decision framework, making it suitable for safety-critical financial applications.
